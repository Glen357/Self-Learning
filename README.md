Please check the ecommerce folder, then app.py contains multiple learning activities that I have been doing.

There are also a couple of component folders, Converters.py and Utils.py

also, there are 2 Excel spreadsheets that I used to find out how to import and manipulate their data

There is a lot of information in this project. I covered a lot over 2 days with this online tutorial. apart from all the comments it also uses the print() function to display information and error handling
